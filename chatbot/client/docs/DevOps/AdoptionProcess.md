tailoring it to your project needs:

1. Understanding
2. Implementing
3. Practicing
4. Utkarshing

## 1 - Understanding

> :checkered_flag: All owners and practitioners have read, understood and
> analyzed below items

1. Go through topics under `understanding` section in overview document of the
   practice you want to adopt or in
   [SoftwareEngineeringPractices document](./SoftwareEngineeringPractices.md).
   The document generally covers the following topics,
   1. Overview of the practice
   2. Why it's needed
   3. What will be the Impact of adopting it
   4. Pre-requisites for effectiveness
   5. Risks of not following the practice
2. Mindset shift required for adopting a new practice

   based on pain points
5. Educating and aligning with customers on the practice as needed
6. Educating and getting the team onboard to adopt the new practice

## 2 - Implementing

> :checkered_flag: All owners and practitioners have started doing below
> activities

1. Defining current state and target state for the practice
2. Aligning with customers on findings and implementation plan if needed
3. Tech Lead, Project Manager and Project Lead can collaborate to identify
   bandwidth for implementation
4. Tech Lead to collaborate with the team and make sure they understand the new
   practice and the responsibilities associated with it
5. Start implementing as per the steps mentioned in the `implementation` section
   in overview document of the practice you want to adopt or in
   [SoftwareEngineeringPractices document](./SoftwareEngineeringPractices.md)

## 3 - Practicing

> :checkered_flag: All owners and practitioners should consistently pursue below
> items

1. All owners and practitioners are consistently following the target state
2. All non-negotiable items are in action except for mutually agreed exceptions
   with cohort leader
3. When team has acquired maximum score in practicing, they are ready for a
   practice audit

## 4 - Utkarshing

> :checkered_flag: All owners and practitioners are operating in a recommended
> state for the practice based on the success criteria below

1. Practice has acquired a score of greater than or equal to 9 in last audit
2. Impact to teams, customers and stakeholders is visible from their feedback

## Evaluation

1. Demo calls to depict progress in each stages above until end of Practicing

When building or deploying cloud applications, two critical
considerations are:

1. **Uptime (Availability)**: Ensures that the application remains accessible
   and operational, minimizing downtime.

2. **Scalability**: The ability to handle varying levels of demand by scaling
   resources up or down as needed.

### High Availability üåê

1. **High availability** focuses on ensuring maximum availability of services
   and applications, regardless of disruptions or events.

2. Azure is a highly available cloud environment with uptime guarantees
   depending on the service. These guarantees are part of the service-level
   agreements (SLA).

### Scalability üöÄ

1. **Scalability** is the ability to adjust resources to match demand. You can
   handle peak traffic by adding resources and reduce costs by scaling down when
   demand decreases.

2. There are two types of scaling:

   1. **Vertical Scaling**: Increases or decreases the capacity of a single
      resource, such as adding more CPUs or RAM to a virtual machine.

   2. **Horizontal Scaling**: Involves adding or removing resources, like
      deploying more virtual machines or containers, to meet demand.

### Reliability üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Reliability** ensures that systems can recover from failures and continue
   operating smoothly.

2. Azure's decentralized, global infrastructure maintains service reliability by
   automatically shifting workloads across regions if needed.

### Predictability üîç

1. **Predictability** can be focused on performance predictability or cost
   predictability :

      balancing adjust resources to maintain consistent performance, adapting to
      changes in demand.

   2. <span class="custom-header">**Cost**</span>: Real-time tracking and tools
      such as the
      [Total Cost of Ownership](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/tco/calculator/)
      and
      [Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/calculator/)
      enable accurate cost forecasting and efficient resource management.

### Security & Governance üîí

1. **Security**: Cloud services handle patches and maintenance automatically.
   Cloud providers also protect against threats such as DDoS attacks, enhancing
   network security.

2. **Governance**: Cloud features support governance and compliance, ensuring
   that resources meet both corporate and regulatory standards.

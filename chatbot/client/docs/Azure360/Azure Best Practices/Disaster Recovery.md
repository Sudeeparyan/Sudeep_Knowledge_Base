1. **Azure Disaster Recovery** involves preparing and managing your applications
   and data to ensure minimal downtime and data loss during unexpected events
   like natural disasters, hardware failures or cyber-attacks.

2. Azure provides various tools and services to create a robust disaster
   recovery strategy that ensures business continuity.

### Azure Disaster Recovery Tools and Services

1. <span class="custom-header">**Azure Site Recovery (ASR)**</span> üîÑ

   1. Provides a comprehensive disaster recovery solution for both on-premises
      and Azure-based workloads.

   2. Replicates your VMs, physical servers and workloads to a secondary
      location (Azure or another region).

   3. Supports both failover (in case of disaster) and failback (returning to
      the original location once the issue is resolved).

2. <span class="custom-header">**Azure Backup**</span> üíæ

   1. A cloud-based backup solution that protects your data by storing backups
      in Azure.

   2. Supports backing up Azure VMs, SQL databases, file shares and on-premises
      workloads.

   3. Provides multiple retention options and granular recovery points to
      minimize data loss.

3. <span class="custom-header">**Azure Availability Zones**</span> üèôÔ∏è

   1. Physically separate data centers within a single Azure region, each with
      independent power, cooling and networking.

   2. Helps ensure high availability and fault tolerance by replicating
      applications and data across multiple zones.

4. <span class="custom-header">**Azure Region Pairs**</span> üåç

   1. Azure pairs regions within the same geography to provide replication and
      failover capabilities.

   2. Ensures that at least one region in a pair remains available during
      planned maintenance or disasters.

   3. Enables data residency and compliance by keeping data within the same
      geography.

5. <span class="custom-header">**Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)**</span> üåê

   1. Replicates your data across two geographically separated Azure regions.

   2. Provides durability and protection against regional failures.

   3. Suitable for scenarios where regulatory requirements or business policies
      mandate data replication across regions.

6. <span class="custom-header">**Azure Traffic Manager**</span> üåê

   1. A DNS-based traffic load balancer that directs traffic to healthy service
      endpoints across different regions or availability zones.

   2. Enables automatic failover and ensures that traffic is redirected to the
      nearest or most responsive location.

   3. Useful for multi-region deployments to maintain service availability
      during regional outages.

7. <span class="custom-header">**Azure Load Balancer and Application
   Gateway**</span> ‚öñÔ∏è

   1. Provides load balancing across multiple instances of your application
      within a region or across regions.

   2. Distributes incoming traffic to multiple back-end resources, improving
      availability and fault tolerance.

### How Azure Disaster Recovery Works

1. <span class="custom-header">**Define Your Recovery Objectives**</span> üìà

   1. **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: The maximum acceptable time to restore
      your application or data after a disruption.

   2. **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: The maximum acceptable amount of data
      loss measured in time (e.g., 5 minutes of data).

2. <span class="custom-header">**Replicate Resources**</span> üîÑ

   1. Use **Azure Site Recovery** to replicate your virtual machines and
      applications to a secondary region or on-premises data center.

   2. Set up replication for Azure VMs, on-premises VMs, physical servers and
      databases.

   3. Configure replication policies to define the frequency and retention of
      replication data.

3. <span class="custom-header">**Backup Critical Data**</span> üíæ

   1. Use **Azure Backup** to back up critical data regularly.

   2. Define backup policies with appropriate retention schedules and recovery
      points.

   3. Verify that backup jobs are completed successfully and test restores
      periodically.

4. <span class="custom-header">**Deploy Across Multiple Zones and
   Regions**</span> üåê

   1. Deploy applications across **Azure Availability Zones** to ensure high
      availability within a region.

   2. Use **Azure Region Pairs** to replicate and deploy resources across
      geographically separated regions.

5. <span class="custom-header">**Implement Load Balancing and Traffic
   Management**</span> ‚öñÔ∏è

   1. Use **Azure Traffic Manager** to route traffic intelligently across
      multiple regions or availability zones.

   2. Use **Azure Load Balancer** or **Application Gateway** to distribute
      traffic and ensure fault tolerance within regions.

6. <span class="custom-header">**Monitor and Test DR Plans**</span> üîç

   1. Regularly test your disaster recovery plans by performing failover drills
      using Azure Site Recovery.

   2. Monitor DR-related metrics (e.g., replication health, backup status) in
      Azure Monitor or Log Analytics.

   3. Continuously refine and update your DR strategy based on testing results
      and changing business requirements.

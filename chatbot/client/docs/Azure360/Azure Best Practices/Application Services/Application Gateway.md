1. **Azure Application Gateway** is designed for web application security and
   load balancing, providing features like SSL termination, URL-based routing
   and protection against web vulnerabilities. üîê

2. It operates at the application layer and is tailored for web-facing
   applications that need to be secured and efficiently managed. üõ†Ô∏è

### When to use Azure Application Gateway

| Deciding Factors                          | Reason                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Web Application Load Balancing            | When you need to distribute incoming HTTP/HTTPS traffic across multiple backend servers, Application Gateway provides load balancing based on URL, session affinity and other Layer 7 (application layer) attributes, ensuring even distribution of traffic and optimized performance. |
| SSL/TLS Termination                       | Application Gateway can handle SSL termination, reducing the processing load on backend servers and simplifying certificate management.                                                                                                                                                |
| Web Application Firewall (WAF) Protection | When you need to protect your web applications from common threats like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS) and other OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.                                                                                                                              |
| URL-Based Routing                         | When you need to route traffic to different backend servers based on the URL path or domain name.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Microservices Architectures               | When you're deploying a microservices-based application that requires routing traffic to specific services based on the URL or other HTTP attributes.                                                                                                                                  |

### Security Best Practices

When deploying an Azure App Service, following security best practices ensures
application is protected against potential threats and vulnerabilities. Here are
the key considerations

1. <span class="custom-header">**Security & Network Configuration**</span>ðŸ”’

   1. **Use HTTPS for All Communications**: Ensure all traffic to and from the
      app is encrypted using HTTPS. Enforce HTTPS by redirecting all HTTP
      requests to HTTPS in the Azure portal.

   2. **Restrict Access with IP Restrictions**: Configure IP restrictions to
      allow access only from trusted IP ranges or specific networks. This limits
      exposure to only the necessary endpoints.

   3. **Use Virtual Network (VNet) Integration**: Integrate App Service with an
      Azure Virtual Network to securely access resources such as databases,
      storage accounts and other services.

2. <span class="custom-header">**Use Private Endpoints for Secure
   Communication**</span>ðŸ”—

   1. **Deploy Private Endpoints**: Use Private Endpoints to connect App Service
      to Azure resources (e.g., Azure SQL Database, Azure Storage) over a
      private link, ensuring traffic stays within the Azure network and is not
      exposed to the public internet.

   2. **Disable Public Network Access**: Once private endpoints are configured,
      disable public network access to the connected Azure resources to prevent
      unauthorized access.

   3. **Implement Network Security Groups (NSGs)**: Apply Network Security
      Groups (NSGs) to the virtual network to control inbound and outbound
      traffic, allowing only required ports and protocols.

3. <span class="custom-header">**Managed Identity for Secure Resource
   Access**</span>ðŸ”‘

   1. **Use Managed Identity**: Assign a managed identity (system-assigned or
      user-assigned) to App Service to securely access Azure resources (e.g.,
      Azure Key Vault, Azure Storage) without managing credentials.

      1. **System-Assigned Identity**: Automatically managed by Azure and tied
         to the app lifecycle.

      2. **User-Assigned Identity**: Can be shared across multiple Azure
         resources and is managed separately.

   2. **Grant Least Privilege Access**: Use Azure Role-Based Access Control
      (RBAC) to grant only the necessary permissions to the managed identity for
      accessing resources.

4. <span class="custom-header">**Single Sign-On (SSO) for Secure
   Sign-In**</span>ðŸ”‘

   1. **Enable SSO with Azure Entra ID**: Use Azure Entra ID to implement Single
      Sign-On (SSO) for secure user authentication and access management.

:::tip
 
`WEBSITES_CONTAINER_START_TIME_LIMIT` is an App Service setting in Azure that specifies the maximum time allowed for a container to start when running a web app in a Docker container. If the container takes longer than this limit to start, Azure App Service will assume the container failed to start and will stop the attempt.

**Key details:**
    1. **Default Value:** 230 seconds

    2. **Purpose:** To prevent indefinite waits for a container that might be stuck or failing to start properly.

    3. **Use Case:** You can adjust this setting if you know your container requires more time to start, particularly if it has heavy dependencies or initialization tasks.

This setting is particularly relevant when using App Service for Containers or Azure Web App for Containers.

1. **Azure Deployment Automation** focuses on automating the provisioning,
   configuration and deployment of resources in a consistent, repeatable and
   reliable manner.

2. It helps eliminate manual deployment processes, reduces the risk of errors
   and speeds up the release cycles.

### Deployment Automation Tools

1. <span class="custom-header">**Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates**</span>
   üåê

   1. ARM templates are JSON files that define the resources and configurations
      needed for your Azure deployment.

   2. Supports Infrastructure as Code (IaC), enabling versioning, reuse and
      automation of your Azure environments.

   3. Ideal for automating the deployment of complex environments with multiple
      resources (e.g., virtual machines, databases, networks).

2. <span class="custom-header">**Azure Blueprints**</span> üìã

   1. Azure Blueprints enable you to define a repeatable set of Azure resources
      and policies that can be deployed together.

   2. Useful for enforcing compliance and standardizing deployments across
      different environments.

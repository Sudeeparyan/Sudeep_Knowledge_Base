### What is Private Endpoint

1. A Private Endpoint in Azure is a network interface that connects privately
   and securely to an Azure service by using Azure Private Link. 🌐

2. It enables access to Azure services, such as Azure Storage, Azure SQL
   Database and custom services, over a private IP address within a virtual network
   (VNet).📦

3. This eliminates the need for data to traverse the public internet, enhancing
   security and reducing exposure to external threats. 🔒

### When to Use Private Endpoint

| Deciding Factors                           | Reason                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Example                                                                                                                           |

| Securing Sensitive Data                    | Use Private Endpoints to secure access to Azure services that handle sensitive or confidential data, ensuring that all traffic remains within your private network and doesn’t traverse the public internet. | Access a sensitive Azure SQL Database that contains financial data through a Private Endpoint, blocking any public access.        |
| Minimizing Exposure to the Public Internet | Use Private Endpoints to reduce the attack surface of your Azure services by disabling public access and ensuring that only authorized users within your VNet can access the service.                        | Connect to an Azure Storage account that stores critical business files via a Private Endpoint to prevent public internet access. |
| Reducing Latency                           | Use Private Endpoints to reduce latency by routing traffic directly through Azure’s private backbone network rather than through the public internet.                                                        | Access a geographically distant Azure Storage account with lower latency by using a Private Endpoint.                             |

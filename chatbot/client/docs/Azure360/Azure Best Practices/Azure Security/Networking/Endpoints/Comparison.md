| <span class="custom-header">**Network Security** </span>            | Extends VNet identity to Azure services, securing access over Azure's backbone network.      | Provides private access to Azure services via a private IP address, completely isolated from the internet. |
| <span class="custom-header">**Access and Connectivity**</span>      | Accesses Azure services using public IP, but routes traffic securely within Azure's network. | Accesses Azure services using a private IP from the VNet, with no public IP exposure.                      |
| <span class="custom-header">**Configuration and Management**</span> | Easier to configure, no DNS changes required, uses public endpoints.                         | Requires more configuration, including DNS updates and uses private IP addresses.                          |
| <span class="custom-header">**Public Endpoint Exposure** </span>    | Public endpoints remain accessible unless explicitly restricted.                             | Public endpoint can be completely disabled, enhancing security.                                            |
| <span class="custom-header">**Use Case** </span>                   | Ideal for securing access while maintaining public endpoint flexibility.                     | Ideal for scenarios requiring maximum security, privacy and isolation from the public internet.            |

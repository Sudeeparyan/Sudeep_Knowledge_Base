1. A **Service Endpoint** in Azure allows you to extend your Virtual Network
   (VNet) to include specific Azure services. üåê

2. This means that you can securely connect to Azure services, like Azure
   Storage or Azure SQL Database, directly over the Azure backbone network
   without exposing your data to the public internet. üíª

## When to Use Service Endpoint

| Deciding Factors                      | Reason                                                                                                                                                 | Example                                                                                                                                  |

| Enhancing Security for Azure Services | Use Service Endpoints to secure access to Azure services by ensuring that traffic from your VNet to the service does not traverse the public internet. | Connect to an Azure SQL Database from your VNet using a service endpoint to prevent data from being exposed to the public internet.      |
| Improving Latency and Performance     | Use Service Endpoints to improve performance and reduce latency by keeping traffic within Azure‚Äôs backbone network, avoiding the public internet.      | Reduce latency for an Azure App Service that relies heavily on data stored in Azure Storage by connecting them using a service endpoint. |
| Using with Existing Public Endpoints  | Service Endpoints are beneficial when you want to maintain public endpoint access while ensuring secure traffic flow from your VNet.                   | Allow public access to a web application hosted in Azure App Service while securing backend database access through a service endpoint.  |

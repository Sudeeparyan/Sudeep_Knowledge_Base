### What is Application Security Groups

1. **Application Security Groups (ASGs)** simplifies the management of network
   security rules by allowing to group together virtual machines (VMs) with
   similar functions and apply security rules to those groups.

2. This makes it easier to manage and enforce security policies without needing
   to maintain complex sets of IP addresses.

| Deciding Factors                     | Reason                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Simplifying Security Rule Management | Use ASGs to simplify the management of security rules across multiple VMs.                                                                                                                            |
| Dynamic and Scalable Environments    | In dynamic environments where VMs are frequently added or removed, ASGs are beneficial because security rules automatically apply to any VM added to the group, reducing the need for manual updates. |
| Large-Scale Deployments              | In large-scale deployments where managing individual IP addresses becomes impractical, ASGs offer a scalable way to enforce consistent security policies across your infrastructure.                  |

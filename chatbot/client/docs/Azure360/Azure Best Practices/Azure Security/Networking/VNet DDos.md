| Protecting Public-Facing Applications        | Use DDoS Protection Standard to secure applications exposed to the internet, such as web applications, APIs, or public endpoints, which are more vulnerable to DDoS attacks. | Protect a public-facing e-commerce website that handles sensitive transactions and needs to be available 24/7.                  |
| Enhancing Security for Critical Services     | Use DDoS Protection Standard for mission-critical services that require high availability and cannot afford downtime caused by a DDoS attack.                                | Apply DDoS protection to a financial application that processes real-time transactions for thousands of users.                  |
| Cost Management for High-Volume Applications | Use DDoS Protection Standard to prevent unexpected costs due to autoscaling or resource usage spikes during an attack, as it includes cost protection features.              | Protect a scalable video streaming service that could experience increased costs due to traffic surges caused by a DDoS attack. |

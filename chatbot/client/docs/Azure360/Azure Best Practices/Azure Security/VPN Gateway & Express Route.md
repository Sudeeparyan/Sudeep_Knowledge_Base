Azure VPN Gateway and Azure ExpressRoute are two different solutions provided by
Azure to connect on-premises networks to Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) securely
and efficiently. üåê

### Azure VPN Gateway

Azure VPN Gateway is a service that enables you to create a secure, encrypted
connection between your on-premises network and your Azure VNets over the public
internet. üîê

### When to use Azure VPN Gateway

| Deciding Factors                  | Reason                                                                        |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Small to Medium-Sized Deployments | When you have smaller workloads or limited bandwidth requirements.            |
| Cost-Sensitive Scenarios          | When you need a secure connection but want to minimize costs.                 |
| Remote Access Needs               | When you need to provide secure access to individual users or remote offices. |

### Azure Express Route

1. Azure ExpressRoute is a dedicated, private connection between your
   on-premises infrastructure and Azure.

2. Unlike VPN Gateway, ExpressRoute does not go over the public internet, but
   instead uses a private connection provided by a connectivity provider. üîå

### When to use Azure Express Route

| Deciding Factors                            | Reason                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Large-Scale or Mission-Critical Deployments | For enterprises with high-performance needs, such as financial institutions or healthcare organizations. |
| High Bandwidth Requirements                 | When you need to transfer large amounts of data between on-premises and Azure.                           |
| Regulatory Compliance                       | When regulatory requirements mandate that your traffic cannot traverse the public internet.              |
| Global Connectivity                         | When you need to connect multiple global offices to Azure with high reliability and performance.         |

### Comparison

| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <span class="custom-header">**Connection Type**</span> | Over the public internet using encrypted tunnels.                           | Private connection through a dedicated circuit.                                   |
| <span class="custom-header">**Performance**</span>     | Variable, dependent on internet traffic, generally lower bandwidth.         | High performance with low latency, higher and more consistent bandwidth.          |
| <span class="custom-header">**Security**</span>        | Secure via encryption (IPsec), but traffic goes over the public internet.   | Highly secure, private connection that does not traverse the public internet.     |
| <span class="custom-header">**Cost** </span>           | Generally lower cost, suitable for smaller budgets.                         | Higher cost, suitable for enterprises with greater connectivity needs.            |
| <span class="custom-header">**Availability** </span>   | Dependent on internet stability and VPN Gateway performance.                | High availability with SLA-backed uptime, suitable for critical workloads.        |
| <span class="custom-header">**Use Case**</span>        | Small to medium-sized deployments, remote access, cost-sensitive scenarios. | Large-scale, mission-critical applications, high bandwidth and low latency needs. |

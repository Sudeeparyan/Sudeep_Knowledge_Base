1. Azure Blueprint is a service that enables you to define a repeatable set of
   Azure resources, policies and configurations required to deploy in a cloud
   environment.

2. Blueprints include everything from resource groups, role assignments and
   policies to
   [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview).

3. These blueprints can then be used to ensure that your deployments meet
   specific requirements and standards.

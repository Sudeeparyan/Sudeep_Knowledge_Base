### Region Availability

1. The Azure OpenAI Service is offered in specific Azure regions, allowing users
   to deploy their AI solutions closer to their target audience, which enhances
   latency and performance.

2. Not all models may be available in all regions, so it's important to verify
   availability.

:::tip

1.  Azure OpenAI Service is not yet available in India, but it is accessible in
    regions such as the `East US` and `West Europe`. This means users in India may
    need to deploy their applications in other supported regions.

2.  For the most current region availability, you can refer to the
    [Azure OpenAI Region Availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo-model-availability).

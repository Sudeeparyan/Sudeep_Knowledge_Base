# Python Coding Standards

This document encompasses the coding conventions and guidelines applicable to all Python code that we produce. It is a continuously evolving resource, subject to potential additions of new rules over time.

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide a set of guidelines and best practices for writing high-quality Python code. Python is a widely used programming language that offers many benefits, such as readability, simplicity, and expressiveness. However, Python also allows a lot of flexibility and variation in how code can be written, which can lead to inconsistency, confusion, and errors. Therefore, it is important to follow some common standards and conventions when writing Python code to ensure that it is clear, consistent, and easy to maintain.

This document introduces various [PEP](https://peps.python.org/) standards to focus on while working on Python projects. It also introduces some tools and techniques that can help you improve your Python code quality even further. These include linters, auto-formatters, and code analysis tools. These tools can help you check your code for errors, style issues, complexity, performance, security, and more. They can also help you format your code automatically.

By following this document, you will be able to write beautiful Python code that meets the highest standards of quality and professionalism. You will also be able to collaborate more effectively with other developers, both within and outside the company. Additionally, you will be able to deliver reliable and robust software products that meet the needs and expectations of your customers.

## 2. Zen of Python

The Zen of Python is a collection of 19 "guiding principles" for writing computer programs that influence the design of the Python programming language. These principles are detailed in [PEP 20 - The Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/).

1. **Beautiful is better than ugly.**
2. **Explicit is better than implicit.**
3. **Simple is better than complex.**
4. **Complex is better than complicated.**
5. **Flat is better than nested.**
6. **Sparse is better than dense.**
7. **Readability counts.**
8. **Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.**
9. **Although practicality beats purity.**
10. **Errors should never pass silently.**
11. **Unless explicitly silenced.**
12. **In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.**
13. **There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.**
14. **Now is better than never.**
15. **Although never is often better than _right_ now.**
16. **If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.**
17. **If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.**
18. **Namespaces are one honking great idea—let's do more of those!**

These principles are included as an Easter egg in the Python interpreter, where they can be displayed by entering `import this`.

## 3. PEP Standards

**PEP** stands for **Python Enhancement Proposal**. PEPs are documents that propose and describe new features or provide information about Python. They’re intended to serve as the primary mechanisms for proposing major new features, collecting community input on an issue, and documenting the design decisions that have gone into Python.

**PEP 8**, **PEP 257**, and **PEP 484** are three such proposals that focus on the style and conventions of writing Python code.

### PEP 8

**PEP 8** is a document that provides guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code. The primary focus of PEP 8 is to improve the readability and consistency of Python code. It covers topics like indentation, where to put spaces, how to name variables, etc.

All guidelines and best practices are listed [here](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).

### PEP 257

**PEP 257** provides conventions for Python docstrings. A docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition. Such a docstring becomes the **`__doc__`** special attribute of that object.

Docstring conventions are listed [here](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/).

### PEP 484

**PEP 484**, titled “Type Hints”, introduced the concept of type hints to the Python language. The main goal of PEP 484 is to provide a standard syntax for type annotations, opening up Python code to easier static analysis and refactoring, potential runtime type checking, and (perhaps, in some contexts) code generation utilizing type information.

More details about how to do type hinting are listed [here](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/).

These PEPs are important because they help ensure consistency and readability across Python code. As [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) said, “**Code is read much more often than it is written**”. By following these guidelines, developers can write code that’s easier to understand and maintain.

**Note:** These are guidelines, not laws. They’re meant to help, not to force a particular style. When in doubt, developers should use their best judgment.

## 4. Linters and Formatters

Linters and formatters are essential tools for maintaining high-quality Python code. They help enforce coding standards, improve readability, and prevent bugs.

### 4.1 Different Types of Linters and Their Functions

1. **Error Linter**: Checks the syntax of Python code.
2. **Style Linter**: Ensures that your code adheres to PEP 8 standards.
3. **Docstring Linter**: Verifies compliance with both PEP 8 and PEP 257 standards in your docstrings.
4. **Type Linter**: Static type checking tools that help maintain the integrity of your code using type hints introduced in PEP 484.
5. **Dead Code Linter**: Identifies unused variables, functions, and methods in your code, helping to keep it clean and efficient.
6. **Security Linter**: Checks for potential security risks such as the use of `assert` or `exec` statements, hard-coded passwords, or secret keys in files.
7. **Packaging Linter**: Ensures that your packaging adheres to the standards outlined in various PEPs.
8. **Complexity Analyzer**: Analyzes the complexity of your code, helping you identify areas that may need simplification or refactoring.

### 4.2 Suggested Linters

Below is the list of linters suggested for Python projects.

| Linter               | Types Covered                                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `flake8`             | Error, Style, Dead Code, Complexity                                |
| `pydocstyle`         | Docstring                                                          |
| `mypy`               | Type Hints                                                         |
| `Bandit` *(Optional)* | Security                                                           |
| `Pyroma` *(Optional)* | Style, Docstring, Type, Dead Code, Security, Packaging (Primary)  |

### 4.3 Suggested Formatter

**Black** is widely used by the Python community. Black automatically formats your code to adhere to PEP 8 standards. It offers speed, consistency, and eliminates the need for constant reminders about formatting from tools like `flake8`.

**Note:** Black covers only a subset of standards that do not require human intervention. Therefore, the linters listed above are required to cover PEP standards completely.

## 5. Best Practices

Below is a list of best practices to follow in addition to using linters and formatters to adhere to PEP 8 and PEP 257.

### Limit Maximum Line Length to 100 Characters

While PEP 8 recommends a maximum of 79 characters per line, many developers find this limit too restrictive. Therefore, a maximum of 100 characters per line has been adopted as a common best practice across. Please note: NI also adheres to the 100-character standard.

### Use Descriptive Names

Use descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, modules, and more so that others can easily understand your code. The use of descriptive names can eliminate the need for code comments, as the code itself will be self-explanatory in most cases.

### Comment and Document

Write comments for your code and maintain good documentation. This helps others understand the purpose of your code, especially when it involves complex logic.

### Error Handling

Always anticipate and handle potential errors in your code. Using error handling mechanisms like `try/except` blocks can help make your code more robust and less prone to crashing.

### Avoid Using Single-Letter Variables

Unless it’s a very short script or a temporary variable, use meaningful names to make your code much easier to understand.

### Code Reusability and Minimal Duplication

Aim to make your code as reusable as possible. If you find yourself writing the same code more than twice, consider creating a function or class for it. Additionally, consider splitting your code into multiple modules instead of a single large module. This approach enhances code reliability and reduces the chances of merge conflicts during parallel development.

### Use of Libraries

Leverage Python’s extensive standard library and third-party modules instead of trying to reinvent the wheel. Utilizing libraries can enhance the robustness of your code as they have already addressed numerous corner cases, making your code less susceptible to errors.

## 6. Challenges

Below are a few common challenges faced by project teams:

### Learning Curve

It can take time for developers to learn how to use linters and formatters effectively and to understand the error messages they produce. However, developers will become accustomed to the standards as they use these linters more frequently.

### Performance

Running linters and formatters can slow down the development process, especially in large codebases, because they parse and analyze the entire codebase every time they run.

**Note:** Make sure to disable "**Editor: Format on Type**" to avoid overloading the IDE. Instead, "**Editor: Format on Save**" can be used.

### False Positives and Negatives

Linters can sometimes report errors that are not actual problems (false positives) or fail to catch real issues (false negatives). While false positives can be addressed through configuration, false negatives should be carefully reviewed to ensure they do not hide critical issues.

### Formatting Changes during Code Review

When a linter or formatter makes changes to code, it can complicate the code review process as reviewers need to distinguish between original changes and formatting changes. This issue can be mitigated if everyone in the team adheres to the Black formatter and consistently follows its formatting rules.

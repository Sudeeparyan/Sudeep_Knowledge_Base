# The Pragmatic Programmer

This is a summary of `The Pragmatic Programmer`, by Andrew Hunt and David
Thomas.

This is started from the

## Preface

The word pragmatic comes from the Latin `pragmaticus`. “skilled in
business”—which in turn is derived from the Greek `πραγματικός`, meaning “fit
for use.”

The book aims to give an understanding of the basic principles of computer
science.

Pragmatic Programmers get the job done and do it well.

## Chapter 1. A Pragmatic Philosophy

What distinguishes Pragmatic Programmers?

We feel it’s an attitude, a style, a philosophy of approaching problems and
their solutions. They think beyond the immediate problem, placing it in its
larger context and seeking out the bigger picture.

### 1.-It's Your Life

It is your life. You own it. You run it. You create it.

If technology seems to be passing you by, make time (in your own time) to study
new stuff that looks interesting. You’re investing in yourself, so doing it
while you’re off the clock is only reasonable.

> **Tip 3: You Have Agency**
>
> Take charge and do what it takes to get to next level.

### 2.-The Cat Ate My Source Code

Pragmatic Programmers take responsibility and ownership for actions towards
career advancement, learning, education, projects and day-to-day work.

Team Trust - Your team needs to trust and rely on you and vice-versa. Take
responsibility and be ready to be held accountable.

> **Tip 4: Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses**

Instead of excuses, provide options. Don't say it can't be done; explain what
can be done to salvage the situation. Ask what you need to get things going -
more time to prototype, automated testing, up skill... just ask

### 3. Software Entropy

One broken window left unfixed for any substantial length of time, instills in
the inhabitants of the building a sense of abandonment—a sense that the powers
that be don't care about the building. So another window gets broken. People
start littering. Graffiti appears. Serious structural damage begins. In a
relatively short space of time, the building becomes damaged beyond the owner's
desire to fix it, and the sense of abandonment becomes a reality.

> **Tip 5: Don't Live with Broken Windows**
>
> Don't let tech-debt (software rot) creep in. Fix it!

Don’t leave “broken windows’’ (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code)
un-repaired. Fix each one as soon as it is discovered.

### 4.-Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs

The three soldiers returning home from war were hungry. When they saw the
village ahead their spirits lifted—they were sure the villagers would give them
a meal. But when they got there, they found the doors locked and the windows
closed. After many years of war, the villagers were short of food and hoarded
what they had.

Undeterred, the soldiers boiled a pot of water and carefully placed three stones
into it. The amazed villagers came out to watch.

“This is stone soup,” the soldiers explained. “Is that all you put in it?” asked
the villagers. “Absolutely—although some say it tastes even better with a few
carrots…” A villager ran off, returning in no time with a basket of carrots from
his hoard.

A couple of minutes later, the villagers again asked “Is that it?” “Well,” said
the soldiers, “a couple of potatoes give it body.” Off ran another villager.

Over the next hour, the soldiers listed more ingredients that would enhance the
soup: beef, leeks, salt, and herbs. Each time a different villager would run off
to raid their personal stores.

Eventually, they produced a large pot of steaming soup. The soldiers removed the
stones, and they sat down with the entire village to enjoy the first square meal
any of them had eaten in months.

It's time to bring out the stones. Work out what you can reasonably ask for.
Develop it well. Once you've got it, show people, and let them marvel. Then say
"Of course, it would be better if we added…."

_People find it easier to join an ongoing success._

> **Tip 6: Be a Catalyst for Change**
>
> Most software disasters start out too small to notice, and most project
> overruns happen a day at a time.

If you take a frog and drop it into boiling water, it will jump straight back
out again. However, if you place the frog in a pan of cold water, and then
gradually heat it, the frog won't notice the slow increase in temperature and
will stay put until cooked.

Most software disasters start too small to notice, and most project overruns
happen a day at a time. Systems drift from their specifications feature by
feature, while patch after patch gets added to a piece of code until there’s
nothing of the original left. It’s often the accumulation of small things that
breaks morale and teams.

Don't be like the frog. Keep an eye on the big picture.

> **Tip 7: Remember the Big Picture**

### 5.-Good enough software

The phrase “good enough’’ does not imply sloppy or poorly produced code. All
systems must meet their users’ requirements to be successful, and meet basic
performance, privacy, and security standards. We are simply advocating that
users be given an opportunity to participate in the process of deciding when
what you’ve produced is good enough for their needs. The scope and quality of
the system you produce should be specified as part of that system's
requirements.

Involved Users in trade-offs

It would be unprofessional to ignore users’ requirements simply to add new
features to the program, or to polish up the code just one more time. We’re not
advocating panic: it is equally unprofessional to promise impossible time scales
and to cut basic engineering corners to meet a deadline.

Don’t spoil a perfectly good program by over-embellishment and overrefinement.

> **Tip 8: Make Quality a Requirements Issue**

Great software today is often preferable to perfect software tomorrow. **Know
When to Stop**

### 6.-Your Knowledge Portfolio

> _An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest_
>
> - Benjamin Franklin

- Serious investors invest regularly—as a habit.
- Diversification is the key to long-term success.
- Smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and
  high-risk,high-reward investments.
- Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return.
- Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically

Invest in the same guidelines in your knowledge portfolio.

#### Building Your Portfolio

- Invest regularly - Build a habit of learning
- Diversify - The more different things you know, the more valuable you will be
- Manage risk - Don't put all tech eggs in one basket
- Buy low, sell High - Learn emerging tech, be an early adopter
- Review and re-balance - Keep adapting

> **Tip 9: Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio**

#### Goals

- Learn at least one new language every year.
- Read a technical book each month.
- Read nontechnical books, too.
- Take classes/courses. Attend conferences/workshops
- Participate in local user groups & meetups.
- Experiment with different environments.
- Stay current.

You need to ensure that the knowledge in your portfolio is accurate and unswayed
by either vendor or media hype.

> **Tip 10: Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear**

You need to ensure that the knowledge in your portfolio is accurate and unswayed
by either vendor or media hype.

Don't just believe in the first link that shows up in the search. Tips for
critical thinking

- Ask the "Five Whys" - Keep digging deeper
- Who does this benefit
- What is the context - One size doesn't fit all
- When or Where would this work? - What next, what next next?
- Why is this a problem?

### 7.-Communicate

A good idea is an orphan without effective communication.

As developers, we communicate all the time - code, meetings, documentation etc.

> **Tip 11: English is Just Another Programming Language**

As with all forms of communication, the trick here is to gather feedback. Don’t
just wait for questions: ask for them. Look at body language and facial
expressions.

- Know what you want to say. Plan what you want to say. Write an outline.
- Know your audience. (WISDOM acrostic)
  - What do they **Want**?
  - What is their **Interest**?
  - How **Sophisticated** are they?
  - How much **detail** do they want?
  - Who do you want to **Own** the information?
  - How can you **Motivate** them to listen?
- Choose your moment: Understanding when your audience needs to hear your
  information.
- Choose a style: Just the facts, large bound reports, or simple memos.
- Make it look good: Add a good-looking vehicle to your important ideas and
  engage your audience.
  - Choose an appealing style, avoid spelling mistakes
- Involve your audience: Get their early feedback, and pick their brains.
- Be a listener: Encourage people to talk by asking questions.
- Get back to people: Keep people informed afterward.

> **Tip 12: It's Both What You Say and the Way You Say It** The more effective
> that communication, the more influential you become

Pragmatic Programmers embrace documentation as an integral part of the overall
development process.

> **Tip 13: Build Documentation In, Don’t Bolt It On**

Don't mechanically add comments. Restrict your non-API commenting to discussing
why something is done, its purpose and its goal.

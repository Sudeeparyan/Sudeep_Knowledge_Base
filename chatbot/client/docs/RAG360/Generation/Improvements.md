### Key Strategies in Generation

To enhance the generation phase in RAG, several strategies can be employed to
improve the quality of the output:

#### 1. **Context Curation**

Efficient context curation involves refining the retrieved information to ensure
that only the most relevant and concise content is fed to the LLM. This process
includes:

    1. **Reranking**: Reordering the document chunks to highlight the most pertinent results first, reducing noise and ensuring the LLM processes the most relevant information.

    2. **Context Selection/Compression**: Using small language models (SLMs) to detect and remove unimportant tokens, transforming the context into a more manageable form for the LLM without sacrificing crucial information.

#### 2. **Response Synthesis Approaches**

This involves generating a response through iterative refinement and
summarization:

    1. **Iterative Refinement**: Sending the retrieved context to the LLM in segments to allow step-by-step refinement of the answer.

    2. **Summarization**: Summarizing the context to fit within the prompt, ensuring a concise and relevant answer.

    3. **Multiple Answers and Concatenation**: Generating multiple answers from different context chunks and then concatenating or summarizing them to form a cohesive response.

#### 3. **Encoder and LLM Fine-Tuning**

Fine-tuning both the Encoder and LLM within the RAG pipeline to improve
performance:

    1. **Encoder Fine-Tuning**: Enhancing the quality of embeddings to improve context retrieval.

    2. **Ranker Fine-Tuning**: Using a cross-encoder to rerank the retrieved results, especially useful when the base Encoder's results lack confidence.

    3. **RA-DIT Technique**: Fine-tuning both the LLM and the Retriever using triplets of query, context, and answer, aligning the models more effectively.

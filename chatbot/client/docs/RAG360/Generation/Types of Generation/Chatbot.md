### Example Scenario

Here is the example as it is:

#### **Input**

```js
messages = [
  { role: "system", content: "You are friendly chatbot." },
  { role: "user", content: "Hi, my name is Isa" },
];
response = get_completion_from_messages(messages, (temperature = 1));
print(response);
```

#### **Output**

```js
Hello Isa! It's nice to meet you. How can I assist you today?
```

---

#### **Input**

```js
messages = [
  { role: "system", content: "You are friendly chatbot." },
  { role: "user", content: "Yes, can you remind me, What is my name?" },
];
response = get_completion_from_messages(messages, (temperature = 1));
print(response);
```

#### **Output**

```js
I'm sorry, but I don't have access to your personal information or know your name. If you'd like, you can tell me your name and I can remember it for future conversations.
```

#### **Input**

```js
messages = [
  { role: "system", content: "You are friendly chatbot." },
  { role: "user", content: "Hi, my name is Isa" },

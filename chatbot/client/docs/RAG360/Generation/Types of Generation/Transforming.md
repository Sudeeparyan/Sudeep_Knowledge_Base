 ### What is Transforming in Generation Tasks?
 **Explanation:** Transforming within the context of generation tasks primarily involves changing a piece of text from one form or style into another while maintaining the original content's meaning. This could include converting a text from one language to another (translation), changing the tone or style (style transfer), or summarizing long texts into shorter forms.

 **Context:** In the broader scope of natural language processing (NLP), transforming is crucial for creating systems that can interact with humans more naturally and effectively. It helps in bridging language barriers, simplifying information, and making content more accessible.

### Why We Need Transforming
 **Problem Statement:** Language processing tasks often encounter diverse languages and formats, requiring adaptive measures to ensure comprehensibility across different contexts. For instance, comprehending complex legal or technical documents may be challenging for laypersons without some form of transformation.

 **Use Cases:** 
  1. **Translation services** for global communication.
  2. **Content summarization** for quick consumption.
  3. **Style transfer** for creating content suitable for different audiences.

 **Benefits:** The main benefit of mastering transforming tasks includes enhanced accessibility of information across language and style barriers, saving time and resources in content creation and consumption.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Transforming
 **Advantages:**
  1. **Efficiency:** Automates and speeds up the conversion of text across various forms, facilitating quicker comprehension and response times.
  2. **Understanding:** Makes complex texts more understandable and accessible to varied audiences.
  3. **Scalability:** Can be applied on a large scale to different languages and text types without significant additional costs.
 **Disadvantages:**
  1. **Complexity:** The accuracy of transformation such as translation or summarization can be limited by the complexity of the source material.
  2. **Resource Usage:** High-quality transformation requires significant computational resources, especially for training models on large datasets.
  3. **Limitations:** Sometimes transformations may lose the nuance or context of the original text, leading to misinterpretations.

### Example Scenario
Here is the example as it is:

**Input:**

```python
prompt = f"""
Translate the following text to French, Spanish, 
and English pirate: \
```I want to order a basketball```
"""

response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

**Output:**

```
French: Je veux commander un ballon de basket
Spanish: Quiero ordenar un bal√≥n de baloncesto
English pirate: Arrr, I be wantin' to order a basketball, matey!
```

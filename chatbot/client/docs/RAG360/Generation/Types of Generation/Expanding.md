### Types of Generation Tasks: Expanding

#### **What is Expanding?**

1. Expanding in the context of text generation refers to the ability of a system
   to elaborate, extend, or add more detailed information to an existing piece
   of text.

2. It works by using existing content as a seed to generate additional content
   that is relevant and coherent with the original text.

#### **Context**

1. In the broader field of natural language processing (NLP), expanding plays a
   crucial role in applications such as content creation, educational material
   development, and improving engagement in interactive systems like chatbots.

2. It helps in fleshing out sparse information into richer, more detailed
   content.

### Why We Need Expanding

#### **Problem Statement**

    Often, texts like summaries or notes are too brief and lack the necessary details to fully understand or engage with the content.

#### **Use Cases**

1. In academic settings, students can use expanding to develop more detailed
   study notes.
2. Content creators can enhance brief news articles into comprehensive reports.

#### **Benefits**

    Understanding expanding equips individuals with the ability to automatically generate detailed and informative content from minimal input, saving time and enhancing the quality of information.

### Example Scenario


#### **Input**

````js
sentiment = "negative"

# review for a blender
review = f"""
So, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal \
sale for around $49 in the month of November, about \
half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) \
around the second week of December the prices all went \
up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same \
system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or \
so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. \
So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part \
where the blade locks into place doesnâ€™t look as good \
as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I \
plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush \
very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \
blender first then pulverize them in the serving size \
I want in the blender then switch to the whipping \
blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade \
first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade \
if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making \
smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and \
vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the \
spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making \
sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \
that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so \
much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. \
After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. \
I called customer service but the warranty expired \
already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall \
quality has gone done in these types of products, so \
they are kind of counting on brand recognition and \
consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about \
two days.

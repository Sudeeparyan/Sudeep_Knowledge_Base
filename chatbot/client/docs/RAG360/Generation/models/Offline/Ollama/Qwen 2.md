### Understanding Qwen 2

1. Qwen 2 is a specific procedure or algorithm used within the realm of offline
   model generation.

2. This process typically involves the construction or update of predictive
   models that operate without the need for real-time data connectivity.

3. Qwen 2 focuses on leveraging historical data to enhance the model's accuracy
   and reliability before it's deployed in an offline environment.

4. In the larger framework of RAG360's model generation, Qwen 2 represents a
   crucial step where data is processed and modeled with the intent of creating
   robust predictive mechanisms.

5. This is essential in scenarios where models need to function effectively
   without continual data updates.

### Why We Need Qwen 2

#### **Problem Statement**

1.  Offline model generation faces challenges such as data relevancy, model
    decay over time without updates, and the need for high initial accuracy.

2.  Qwen 2 addresses these issues by refining the model's ability to generalize
    from historical patterns without subsequent input.

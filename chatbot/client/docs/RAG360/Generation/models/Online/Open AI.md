##### Documentation Links for Python Setup

1. **Installation Guide**

   1. **Python SDK for OpenAI API** Begin by installing the OpenAI Python
      package. Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   pip install openai
   ```

2. **Authentication**

   1. After installation, you need to authenticate using an API key from OpenAI.
      Set up your environment variable as follows (replace 'your-api-key' with
      the actual key):

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
   ```

3. **Using OpenAI with Python**

   1. Here is a simple example to get started with OpenAI's GPT model for text
      generation:

   ```python
   import openai

   openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

   response = openai.Completion.create(
     engine="davinci",
     prompt="Translate the following English text to French: 'Hello, how are you?'",
     max_tokens=60
   )

   print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
   ```

   2. This code snippet sets up the API, sends a prompt to the model, and prints
      the generated response.

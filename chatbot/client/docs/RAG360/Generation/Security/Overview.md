### **What is Security in Generation in RAG?**

1. Security in generation when using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) refers
   to the measures and practices that ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and
   reliability of the generated outputs.

2. RAG models combine the power of large language models with external data
   retrieval capabilities to provide enhanced responses.

3. This topic focuses on how to maintain security when the model accesses and
   retrieves external information during the generation process.

#### **Context**

1. In the broader context of using AI for text generation, incorporating
   security within RAG systems is crucial.

2. Since RAG models interact with external databases or knowledge sources to
   fetch supplemental information, ensuring that this interaction is secure
   prevents misuse of the data and protects against the propagation of
   misinformation.

### Importance of Security in RAG

#### **Problem Statement**

1. The integration of external data sources in RAG systems poses unique security
   challenges, including unauthorized data access, data tampering, and leakage
   of sensitive information.

2. Addressing these challenges is essential to maintain the trustworthiness and
   usefulness of RAG applications.

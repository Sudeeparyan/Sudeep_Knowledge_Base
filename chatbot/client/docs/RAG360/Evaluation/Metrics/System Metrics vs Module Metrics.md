### System Metrics vs Module Metrics in TruLens

#### Overview and Explanation

1. In TruLens, differentiating between system metrics and module metrics is
   crucial for comprehensive evaluation.

2. System metrics evaluate the performance of the entire system as a holistic
   entity, considering all integrated components and their interactions.

3. Conversely, module metrics focus on specific, individual components or
   modules within the system, assessing their performance and functionality
   independently of the rest.

4. System metrics and module metrics together provide a dual perspective on
   model performance, each serving distinct but complementary roles in the
   TruLens framework.

5. System metrics help in evaluating the end-to-end effectiveness of the system,
   while module metrics provide granular insights into specific areas of the
   system.

### Importance and Use Cases

#### **Problem Statement**

Without differentiating between these two types of metrics, it can be
challenging to pinpoint whether issues or successes are due to individual
components or their integrations within the full system. This distinction is
critical for effective troubleshooting, optimization, and scalability.

#### **Use Cases**

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td class="custom-header">System Integration Testing</td>
            <td>System metrics can be used to ensure that all modules work together seamlessly.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="custom-header">Component Development</td>
            <td>Module metrics are crucial during the development and testing phases of specific modules, ensuring each performs its intended function correctly.</td>

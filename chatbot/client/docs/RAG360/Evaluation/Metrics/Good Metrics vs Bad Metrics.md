### Good Metrics vs Bad Metrics in TruLens

#### Overview and Explanation

1. In the context of TruLens, distinguishing between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ metrics is
   vital for effective model evaluation and development.

2. Good metrics provide meaningful, actionable insights that align with the
   overarching goals of a project, while bad metrics might lead to misleading
   conclusions or encourage counterproductive behaviors in model optimization.

3. Metrics in TruLens serve as the quantifiable measures used to assess the
   performance and behavior of models.

4. Choosing the right metrics is crucial for guiding model development, ensuring
   models meet intended purposes and behave predictably in operational
   environments.

### Importance and Use Cases

#### **Problem Statement**

Selecting inappropriate metrics can skew the development process, potentially
causing models to optimize for the wrong outcomes. This misalignment can reduce
the effectiveness of models and might result in unexpected consequences when
deployed in real-world scenarios.

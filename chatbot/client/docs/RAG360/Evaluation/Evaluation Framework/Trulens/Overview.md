### **What is TruLens?**

#### **Explanation**

1. TruLens is an analytical tool used within the Evaluation Framework of
   Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to gain insights into the
   internal mechanisms of machine learning models.

2. It facilitates the visual interpretation and understanding of how different
   input features influence model outputs, which is integral to the validation
   and improvement of RAG models.

3. TruLens fits into the broader RAG systems by providing a clear view of the
   influence paths within the model.

4. This is crucial for developers and researchers aiming to optimize performance
   and ensure the model’s decisions are understandable and justifiable, thus
   integrating into the evaluation frameworks that assess model transparency and
   efficacy.

### **Why We Need TruLens**

#### **Problem Statement**

1. RAG systems, complex by nature, often operate as black boxes with limited
   visibility into their decision-making processes.

2. This lack of transparency can lead to trust issues, particularly in
   applications requiring high accountability.

Incorporating TruLens into the evaluation framework of RAG systems offers a
comprehensive tool for enhancing model accountability and performance, thereby
building trust and improving outcomes in critical applications.

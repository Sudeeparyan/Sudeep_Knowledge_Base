1. **Source connectors** in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are
   essential tools that automate the extraction and integration of data from
   diverse external sources into the system's workflow.

2. They connect to various data environments, such as databases, web APIs, and
   file systems, ensuring data is consistently imported, normalized, and ready
   for processing.

3. This functionality is vital for maintaining the accuracy, efficiency, and
   scalability of RAG systems, particularly in handling large and varied data
   sets.

### Why We Need Source Connectors

1. The challenge in many AI and data-driven applications, including RAG systems,
   lies in effectively and efficiently harnessing data that is dispersed across
   multiple sources and formats.

2. Without robust mechanisms to collect this data, its utility in enhancing
   decision-making processes and operational efficiency is greatly diminished.

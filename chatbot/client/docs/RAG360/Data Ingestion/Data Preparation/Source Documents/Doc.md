### What is Extraction of Content Inside DOC Files?


1. Extracting content from DOC files automates the retrieval of text, tables,
   images, and other data from Microsoft Word documents, simplifying access and
   manipulation without manual intervention.

2. This process is crucial for data preparation in handling large volumes of
   documents, ensuring accurate extraction and formatting for further analysis,
   storage, or processing within broader data workflows.

### Problem Statement:

DOC files are ubiquitous in business and academia but often contain unstructured
data that is difficult to parse and utilize effectively. Manual data extraction
from DOC files is tedious, error-prone, and inefficient.

### FAISS Vector Database in RAG Systems

1. FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library developed by Facebook AI
   Research for efficient similarity search in large-scale dense vector
   databases.

2. In Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, especially those utilizing
   in-memory vector storage, FAISS excels in delivering rapid query capabilities
   and high efficiency in processing large volumes of vectorized data, making it
   ideal for applications requiring fast retrieval times.

3. In RAG systems, where speed and accuracy are crucial, FAISS enables efficient
   indexing and similarity search of vectors, ensuring quick and precise
   matching of query inputs with relevant data.

### Why We Need FAISS Vector Database

1. Handling similarity searches in large-scale vector databases typically
   involves significant computational overhead and can become a bottleneck in
   RAG systems, particularly when these operations are not optimized.

2. FAISS addresses this challenge by employing optimized algorithms for
   clustering and indexing vectors, thereby accelerating the search process even
   in very large datasets.

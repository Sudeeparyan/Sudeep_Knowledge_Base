### Vector Storage in RAG Systems

1. Vector Storage in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems refers to the
   process and infrastructure used to store and manage the vector
   representations (both sparse and dense vectors) generated during the
   embedding phase of data ingestion.

2. This aspect of RAG systems is crucial because it ensures that the embeddings,
   which encapsulate significant semantic information about the data, are kept
   in an accessible, efficient, and scalable manner.

3. Proper vector storage allows for quick retrieval, which is essential for
   real-time applications.

#### **Context**

1. In the overall architecture of RAG systems, vector storage serves as a bridge
   between data processing (embedding generation) and data utilization
   (retrieval and generation tasks).

2. It is a core component that impacts the system's response time and accuracy,
   making efficient vector storage a priority for optimizing system performance.

### Why We Need Vector Storage

1. Handling and storing large volumes of high-dimensional vector data
   efficiently pose significant challenges, particularly in terms of
   `scalability`, `speed`, and `accessibility`.

2.These challenges need to be addressed to leverage the full potential of RAG
systems in applications that rely on large datasets and demand quick response
times.

### Recommended

1. Both are same.
2. But if you use Azure App Service, try to go with Qdrant.
3. Qdrant is recommended, there is a use case for keyword only search as it
   supports SPLADE.

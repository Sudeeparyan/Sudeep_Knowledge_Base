### Rockset in RAG Systems

1. Rockset is a real-time indexing database built to manage large-scale data
   with low latency, enabling efficient querying.

2. In Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, Rockset is a key component
   in the '`Online`' category of vector storage, providing robust indexing and
   storage of vector data generated during data ingestion.

3. This allows for rapid, complex real-time queries on the data.

4. In online RAG systems, where immediate access to data with minimal latency is
   critical, Rockset ensures high performance and scalability, supporting the
   dynamic, real-time demands of these applications.

### Why We Need Rockset

1. Managing vector data in RAG systems, especially for real-time applications,
   demands a solution that can handle high throughput and provide instant access
   to the data with complex query capabilities.

2. Traditional databases often struggle with the latency requirements and the
   specific demands of handling high-dimensional vector data efficiently.

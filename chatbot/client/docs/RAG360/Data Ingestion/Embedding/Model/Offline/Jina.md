1. Jina Embedding refers to the use of embedding technologies provided by Jina
   AI, a company specializing in neural search frameworks that enable creating
   search systems powered by machine learning.

2. In the context of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, Jina's
   embedding technology is crucial for creating dense vector embeddings from
   text, images, or any other form of data.

3. These embeddings help the RAG system to perform similarity searches
   efficiently, matching queries with the most relevant data points within a
   sizable database.

### Jina Embedding Models

| Model Name                  | Parameters  | Embedding Dimension |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| jina-embeddings-v2-small-en | 33 million  | 512                 |
| jina-embeddings-v2-base-en  | 137 million | 768                 |
| jina-embeddings-v2-large-en | 435 million | 1,024               |

### Utilizing Jina's Embedding Model

1. Jina's embedding models can be integrated through several methods: 1.
   **Jina's Official API** 2. **Hugging Face** 3. **Ollama**

2. Among these, using **Hugging Face** and **Ollama** is preferred as they allow
   the embedding models to be run locally.

### Using Jina Models via Hugging Face

1. Jina's embedding models are available directly on
   [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-en) and
   can be used with the Sentence Transformers library.

2. While understanding the code structure may take some time, the recommended
   approach is to integrate these models with
   [Llama-index](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/llm/huggingface/).

3. Example

```js
from llama_index.embeddings.huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbedding

embed_model = HuggingFaceEmbedding(model_name="jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-en")

embeddings = embed_model.get_text_embedding("Hello World!")
print(len(embeddings))
print(embeddings[:5])
```

Output

```js
Hello World!
384
[-0.030880315229296684, -0.11021008342504501, 0.3917851448059082, -0.35962796211242676, 0.22797748446464539]
```

### Using Jina Models via Ollama

Jina's embedding models are available directly on
[Ollama](https://ollama.com/jina/jina-embeddings-v2-base-en) by specifying the
model.The recommended approach here is to use the Ollama interface with
[Llama-index](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/embeddings/ollama_embedding/)

#### Example

```js
from llama_index.embeddings.ollama import OllamaEmbedding

ollama_embedding = OllamaEmbedding(
    model_name="jina/jina-embeddings-v2-base-en",
    base_url="http://localhost:11434",
    ollama_additional_kwargs={"mirostat": 0},
)

data_source_embedding = ollama_embedding.get_text_embedding_batch(
    ["This is a passage!", "This is another passage"], show_progress=True
)
query_embedding = ollama_embedding.get_query_embedding("Where is blue?")
```

#### Important considerations

1. If the system running the embedding pipeline is powerful, both the Hugging
   Face and Ollama approaches can be utilized effectively.

2. For setups with a dedicated GPU as separate systems, the preferred approach
   is to use Ollama embeddings. You can configure the GPU as a server and
   replace the base_url in the ollama_embedding with the GPU server URL,
   significantly enhancing the performance of embedding operations.

### Why We Need Jina Embedding

#### **Problem Statement**

1. Dealing with large-scale data in diverse formats can be overwhelming without
   efficient tools to convert this data into a uniform, searchable format.

2. Jinaâ€™s embedding solutions address this challenge by converting heterogeneous
   data into vector space, where it becomes easier to perform operations like
   similarity search, clustering, and classification.

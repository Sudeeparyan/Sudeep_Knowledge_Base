1. A **Dense Vector** in the context of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
   systems is a compact, multi-dimensional representation of data, such as text
   or images, created by embedding models.

2. Unlike sparse vectors that contain many zero-values, each dimension in a
   dense vector carries information, ensuring no data is wasted.

3. This dense packing of data makes dense vectors essential in RAG systems,
   where they enable the capturing of semantic richness, facilitating nuanced
   understanding and processing of the data.

4. This characteristic is crucial for tasks requiring real-time decision-making
   and analysis, as it enhances the quality and reliability of the RAG system's
   outputs by ensuring that the vectors reflect comprehensive and relevant
   information.

### Why We Need Dense Vectors

1. Managing high-dimensional data efficiently while retaining all its semantic
   details is a significant challenge, especially in real-time systems where
   quick processing is critical.

2. Dense vectors address this issue by providing a robust, informationally rich
   data format that enhances the performance of RAG systems.

**Vector databases** store these embeddings and calculate the distance
between the two vectors. Distance metrics show how similar or dissimilar two
vector embeddings are. The search query is converted to a vector, similar to the
data vectors, and the distance value determines how close the vectors are.

    1. To create these dense vectors, we need GPU. There are many open source embedding models to create the dense vectors. You can see [MTEB Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard)

    2. We use Commercial **OpenAI** model to generate the dense vectors. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings).

### Use Cases

1. **Search**: Results are ranked by relevance to a query string.
2. **Clustering**: Text strings are grouped by similarity.
3. **Recommendations**: Items with related text strings are recommended.
4. **Anomaly detection**: Outliers with little relatedness are identified.
5. **Diversity measurement**: Similarity distributions are analyzed.
6. **Classification**: Text strings are classified by their most similar label.

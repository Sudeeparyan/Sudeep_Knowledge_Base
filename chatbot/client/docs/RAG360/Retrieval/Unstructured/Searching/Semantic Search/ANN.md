### ANN

Approximate Nearest Neighbor in the Context of Semantic Search for
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

#### **Explanation**

1. Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search is a key technique in Semantic
   Search within RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) contexts, used to
   efficiently retrieve information that is semantically close to a given query
   from large, unstructured datasets.

2. By focusing on finding data points that are "approximately" the nearest
   neighbors to the query point in high-dimensional spaces, ANN avoids the
   computationally intensive task of locating the absolute closest matches.

3. In the broader architecture of RAG, ANN is essential for enhancing the speed
   and scalability of Semantic Search, supporting the retrieval component by
   enabling quick access to the most relevant information, which the generation
   model subsequently uses to formulate responses, an invaluable feature in
   environments demanding real-time processing and response generation.

### Why We Need ANN in Semantic Search

#### **Problem Statement**

As datasets grow in size and complexity, traditional exact nearest neighbor
search methodologies become impractical due to their high computational costs.
ANN provides a feasible solution by balancing between accuracy and computational
efficiency.

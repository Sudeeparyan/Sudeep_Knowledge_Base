### What is KNN in the Context of Semantic Search?

#### **Explanation**

1. KNN, or K-Nearest Neighbors, is a straightforward yet versatile algorithm
   employed in semantic search to identify the "nearest" data points to a given
   query based on a specific similarity metric.

2. In semantic search applications, KNN ranks documents or data segments by
   their conceptual closeness to input terms, typically utilizing vector space
   representations.

3. Within the broader framework of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG),
   especially in the retrieval of unstructured data, KNN is indispensable.

4. It enhances search capabilities by delivering more nuanced and contextually
   relevant responses to queries, fitting perfectly into the semantic search
   paradigm that focuses on understanding the intent and contextual meanings of
   user queries.

### Why We Need KNN for Semantic Search

#### **Problem Statement**

1. Traditional search algorithms often struggle with understanding the
   contextual nuances of language, leading to irrelevant or sub-optimal search
   results.

2. KNN addresses this by using distance metrics in a feature space to return
   results that are contextually closer to the search input.

### What is Meta-Data Filtering?

1. Meta-data filtering involves sifting through meta-data associated with
   documents or information resources to enhance the search results in a
   retrieval system.

2. Meta-data, which includes details like the author, date created, keywords,
   and summary, helps in refining search queries to produce more relevant
   outcomes.

3. In the broader schema of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems,
   meta-data filtering acts as a crucial mechanism. It tackles the challenge of
   pinpointing relevant information from unstructured data sources, ensuring
   that the generation component of RAG has pertinent content to work with for
   creating accurate and contextually appropriate outputs.

### Why We Need Meta-Data Filtering

1. Organizations and individuals face the challenge of
accessing relevant information quickly due to the voluminous amounts of
unstructured data available.

1.  Sifting through this data manually is
time-consuming and often impractical.

### Keyword Extraction

1. The first step in query routing involves extracting keywords (entities) from the
query. 

2. `Filtering:` These keywords are then used to filter through metadata
within the chunks of data. 

3. This filtering process helps narrow down the search
scope, making the retrieval process more efficient.

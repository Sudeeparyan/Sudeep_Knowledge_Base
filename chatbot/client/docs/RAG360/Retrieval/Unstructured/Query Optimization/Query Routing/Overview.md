### What is Query Routing?

1. Query Routing in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems optimizes query
   handling by directing each query through the most suitable RAG pipelines.

2. This process enhances the relevance and accuracy of the generated answers by
   leveraging metadata and semantic information to determine the best processing
   path for each query.

3. In the broader context of a RAG system, Query Routing is vital for improving
   retrieval efficiency and effectiveness, enabling the system to adaptively
   respond to various query types with accurate and contextually appropriate
   information.

### Why Do We Need Query Routing?

The challenge in a RAG system is effectively handling a wide range of queries,
each with varying levels of complexity and specificity. Without a tailored
approach, the system may struggle to provide accurate and relevant information,
leading to suboptimal user experiences.

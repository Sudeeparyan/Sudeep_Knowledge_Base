### What is LLM Reranker?

1. LLM Reranker is a part of a retrieval system used in Retrieval Augmented
   Generation (RAG) to refine and improve the selection of relevant documents
   based on language model predictions.

2. It typically employs large language models to reevaluate and rank the
   relevance of documents retrieved during an initial search phase. This
   approach helps in prioritizing the most relevant or useful texts for
   generating responses or completing tasks.

#### **Context**

1. In the broader scope of RAG, LLM Reranker integrates into the Unstructured
   Retrieval category where its function is vital for ensuring the quality and
   precision of information that feeds into the generation model.

2. By focusing on high-relevance documents, it enhances the overall
   effectiveness of the RAG system.

### Why We Need LLM Rerankers

Initially retrieved results might not always align closely with the query's
intent, leading to suboptimal response generation. The LLM Reranker addresses
this by refining the selection set to improve contextual relevance.

#### **Use Cases**

LLM Rerankers are crucial in applications like chatbots, information retrieval
systems, and assistance in research where precision in response generation is
paramount.

#### **Benefits**

The main benefits include improved accuracy in data retrieval, enhanced quality
of generated content, and a more reliable information retrieval process, leading
to better user satisfaction.

### **Example Scenario: User Query Handling in Customer Support**

#### 1. Situation

    A user asks detailed product-related questions in a customer service chat.

#### 2. Steps/Workflow

      1. Initial broad retrieval of documents mentioning the product.
      2. LLM Reranker evaluates these documents for relevance to the specific questions asked.
      3. Pass the most relevant documents to the generator for final response creation.

#### 3. Outcome

1. The customer receives accurate, relevant, and personalized responses, leading
   to improved satisfaction and reduced follow-up queries.

2. This explanation of LLM Reranker illustrates its role and importance within
   the RAG framework, particularly in enhancing the precision and relevance of
   information used in response generation.

### What is Model-Based Reranking?

1. Model-based reranking is a critical technique within information retrieval
   and augmented generation processes, where a model evaluates and rearranges
   the initial results produced by a search or retrieval query based on their
   relevance.

2. This method is employed to enhance the accuracy and usefulness of the
   retrieval outputs before they are presented to the user or utilized in
   further processing.

3. In the broader framework of retrieval systems, particularly in retrieval
   augmented generation models like RAG, reranking serves as an essential
   refinement step.

4. After the initial retrieval of data, reranking helps in fine-tuning the
   results using deeper insights and contextual understanding offered by
   advanced machine learning models, thereby improving the quality and relevance
   of the information provided to the end users.

### Why We Need Model-Based Reranking

1. Initial retrieval processes might fetch a broad set of possible results,
   which often includes irrelevant or less relevant information.

2. Without reranking, there could be too much noise in the results, potentially
   leading to suboptimal outcomes in decision-making or data processing.

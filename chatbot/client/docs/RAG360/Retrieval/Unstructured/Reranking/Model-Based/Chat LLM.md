### What is Chat LLM?

1. Chat LLM refers to a language model architecture that utilizes both retrieval
   techniques and large-scale machine learning models to generate responses in
   chat applications.

2. It is designed to enhance the conversation experience through accurate and
   contextually relevant responses, pulling information from an unstructured
   data set.

#### Context:

1. Within the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, the Chat LLM
   functions as a component that specifically leverages reranking of retrieved
   information to ensure the dialogue generated is coherent and closely aligns
   with the context of the conversation.

2. It fits into the broader process of RAG by using the retrieved data to
   augment its generative capabilities, leading to more informed and accurate
   outputs.

### Why We Need Chat LLM

Managing and utilizing vast amounts of unstructured data effectively in
real-time conversation applications is challenging. Without a robust system to
retrieve and utilize relevant information, responses can be less accurate or out
of context.

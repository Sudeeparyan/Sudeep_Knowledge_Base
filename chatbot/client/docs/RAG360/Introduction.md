**RAG360** is a comprehensive resource designed,

1. To empower AI developers with the knowledge and tools necessary to create
   their own Generative AI applications.
2. To provide a clear and structured path to become an AI application developer.
3. To enable engineers to make informed decisions about which methods and
   techniques best suit your specific needs from Data cleaning, Embedding
   pipeline, retrieval methods to agentic approach.

## Purpose of RAG360
1. Knowledge on AI is not tied to an engineer or project, but available in the company for everyone to access and improve on.
2. Collection of all knowledge that is gained by the Research on AI domain exploration and projects.
3. Provide some readymade and proven techniques in AI development that is successful in different projects and use cases, so engineers do not need to reinvent the wheel.
4. Becomes a differentiator for why customer should prefer as this should contain methodologies and techniques that are specific to test and measurement needs.
